## Git Workflow

1.  **Merging:** Before merging a branch you are working on, always pull the latest changes from the `dev` branch first to check for and resolve any potential conflicts.
2.  **Branch Scope:** When working on a specific feature or bugfix branch, ensure that your changes are strictly related to that branch's purpose. Avoid introducing unrelated changes from other branches.
3. Before pushing to any branch, run the tests to make sure everything works.
